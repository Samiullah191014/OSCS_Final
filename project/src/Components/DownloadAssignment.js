            In this Online Student Coaching Academy students have the opportunity to access and download their assignments from the platform. Once the assignment is downloaded, students are expected to complete it within a specific duration determined by the instructor. This timeframe ensures that students have adequate time to comprehend and respond to the task appropriately.

            After thoroughly working on the assignment, students are required to upload their completed work back to the platform. The upload process allows students to submit their responses and share their progress with their respective instructors. This seamless upload system not only facilitates efficient assessment but also helps students track their submissions and monitor their academic progress throughout the course.
